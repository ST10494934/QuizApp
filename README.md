Purpose of the App

Exams are difficult, but studying for them doesn’t have to be… Introducing QuizApp, your new flashcard application. Designed by students—for students. We’ve all been there, the night before a test/exam, sitting in front of your notes, trying to get in as much information as possible, but what if there was a better and more fun way to study? That is why we created QuizApp. QuizApp is equipped with questions and answers to make studying more effective and fun. Just enter the name of your choice, then proceed to the questions. The options include true/false answers that help you study historical facts using flashcards and also allow you to go back and review the questions you got incorrect, so you can learn from your mistakes and improve. 

Objective:
Present 5 history-based true/false questions.
Display immediate feedback to the user for each answer, whether correct or incorrect.
Score and summarize performance at the end.
Provide users with a review of the correct answers and personalised feedback based on the result.
Create a visually appealing user interface with images and proper navigation.
 

Design Considerations 

Several factors, with careful thought and consideration, were considered in the design of QuizApp to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience: 

-Simplicity and Ease of Use: Students are always short of time, thus we understand that they do not have time to learn complex interfaces that make it difficult to navigate through an app QuizApp was designed to ensure users never have to battle through this. It features a minimalistic and easy-to-understand layout with clear instructions, making studying quick and effective. 

-Colour and Aesthetics: QuizApp was designed to be fun! That is why we choose ‘fun’ colours that attract users to go on and see what’s next. The app also includes pictures, which may help visual learners when using the app to improve attention and memory. These elements combined motivate users to continue studying. 

-Personalization: Each user using the app can enter their own username and get personalized feedback based on their responses. Thus, allowing the user to feel connected with the app and more personal, a type of feeling that no textbook or note can give. 
 
Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions

GitHub and GitHub Actions were used throughout the creation of my app, QuizApp
-Version control was used to organise the development of QuizApp and allowed me to easily track all my changes made to the code/program. 
-My code was hosted on GitHub, which allowed me to access the code from several devices easily. 
-Due to my project being hosted on GitHub, it allowed my project to be stored in a secure location. 
-The committing and pushing of my app onto GitHub allowed me to access all the previous versions of my project to aid with resolving any problems that accrued while programming. 
-During the programming of my application, I made use of GitHub Actions to automate important steps, such as automated debugging (through workflows), which helped catch any issues early on in the programming process and resolve them, thus improving the reliability of my app.

Testing and Debugging 

-Testing was done through the use of entering various inputs manually, and running the app on several different devices to ensure that the app works as expected. 
-Android Studio’s built-in debugger and logcat were used to test the app and diagnose crashes or unexpected behaviour. 
-GitHub Actions also aided in the debugging process by catching any errors on code push, allowing issues to be resolved quickly.
